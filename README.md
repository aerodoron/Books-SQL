# Books-SQL
The COVID-19 pandemic and the lock downs imposed on people across the world caused people to change their day-to-day lives. People who used to be busy and barely had time to sit down, were forced to slow down and stay at home. This meant that more and more people spent their time reading books - causing an influx of startups developing apps specifically for book readers and book lovers.  The database analyzed in this analysis is of one of the services competing on this newly, re-emerging, market. This database contains information on books, publishers, authors, number of pages, reviewers, reviews and ratings. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.
